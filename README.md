## Extracting text from images using pytesseract
This repo contains a simple process to extract text from images in PDF files using OCR.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technique of extracting or reading text from printed or scanned images, handwritten images
and convert them into string format that can be accessable. 

Here, we are going to use pytesseract which is a wrapper for the [Tesseract-OCR engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

## Libraries 
* fitz 
* PIL 
* pytesseract

## pytesseract installation
You can either install via pre-built binary package from [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html) or build it from [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Compiling.html).

Check full [pytesseract installation process](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/).
